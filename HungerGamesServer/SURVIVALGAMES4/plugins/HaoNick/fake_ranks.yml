# Explantation of fake_rank system of HaoNick:
# You can just copy a rank block and paste it again with a different name.
# If you want to have a sorted scoreboard, be sure to make an order in the "name" of tab entry of each rank.
# Example: 003mvp is above 004mvp
#
# Important: You need to set a COLOR if you are using 1.13 or HIGHER.
# Take a look here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/ChatColor.html
# You see there colors like RED, GRAY. Write these colors in the uppercase in the color entry if you want to use it.
# Only one color can be used!

# Each fake_rank has its own permission. Just give the specific fake_rank the permission!
# If you have a permission plugins that allows you to give '*' permission, just set the permissions of OTHER
# ranks to false (- permission).
